        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>These blackberry muffins are an utter delight! Just catching a whiff while they bake will leave your mouth watering. As a bonus, this recipe swaps out half of the flour for protein powder and doesn't have any added sugar - so they're delicious and healthy! <em>This recipe yields ten muffins.</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plant-based milk of choice + 1 Tbsp lemon juice OR white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 overripe bananas</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups flour (see notes for options)</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>2 scoops Enduro Bites Vanilla Recovery Protein Powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 - 2 cups blackberries (fresh or frozen)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine plant-based milk of choice and lemon juice or vinegar in a liquid measuring cup and let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, mash bananas thoroughly. Add eggs, vanilla, and homemade buttermilk (from step 1) and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add flour, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and Vanilla Recovery Protein Powder to the bowl. Stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>Add in the blackberries!</li>
            <li>Cover bowl and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to bake your muffins, preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare a muffin tin by greasing each muffin cup with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Remove batter from fridge. Batter will be thick, but try not to stir it as you scoop batter into each muffin cup. <strong>Fill to the top!</strong> Recipe should divide into 10 muffins.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a dash of cinnamon on the top of each muffin.</li>
            <li>Bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 8 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for another 12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out cleanly.</li>
            <li>Remove the muffins from the oven and let cool in the pan on a cooling rack. Then remove from the pan (a plastic knife works wonders) and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Make it vegan by replacing eggs with flax eggs.</li>
            <li>Flour options: whole wheat flour, white whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, fluten-free all-purpose blend, whole wheat pastry flour. These will all yield slightly different flavors and textures. Whole wheat will be more dense, all-purpose will be lighter and fluffier. White whole wheat will fall in between. I haven't experimented with gluten-free yet, but I imagine it would work just fine.</li>
            <li>For a sweeter muffin, add a few tablespoons of honey or pure maple syrup to the batter.</li>
        </ul>
