        <h3>Descriptions:</h3>
        <p>I love making this banana bread for brunch on a rest day after a big adventure in the
            mountains or for dessert after a long day of hard training. The duo of complex carbohydrates in
            the whole wheat flour and simple carbohydrates in the honey and bananas is a perfect way to
            replenish glycogen stores in your muscles. Additionally, the protein in the Recovery Protein
            Powder provides the building blocks for repair and growth of your muscles after exercise. Enjoy
            this healthy and delicious treat as you recover from one adventure and refuel for the next!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 large bananas (the more ripe, the better)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup milk of choice (soy, almond, oat, dairy)</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, plus more to swirl on top</li>
            <li>2 scoops Enduro Bites Vanilla Recovery Protein Powder</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cup flour of choice (see notes below)</li>
            <li><em>Optional add-ins:</em> chopped nuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit, fresh banana slices, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x5in loaf pan or 9in round pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the oil and honey together with a whisk. Add eggs and beat well, then whisk in the mashed bananas and milk.</li>
            <li>Add baking soda, baking powder, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, and protein powder. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and stir until just combined. Gently fold in any optional add-ins as desired.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into prepped pan and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. Run the tip of a knife across the batter in a zig-zag pattern for a swirled effect.</li>
            <li>If using a loaf pan, bake for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If using a round pan, bake for 30 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let the bread cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes, then run a butter knife around the edges to help loosen the bread from the sides of the pan. Slice and <strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
